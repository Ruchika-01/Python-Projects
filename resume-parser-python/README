# Resume Parser (Core Python)

A modular, rule-based resume parsing system built using core Python.  
The project focuses on clean architecture, explainable logic, and real-world
document processing rather than black-box machine learning models.

This project demonstrates strong Python fundamentals, software design principles,
and the ability to build maintainable and extensible systems.

## Features

- Supports PDF and DOCX resume files
- Rule-based section detection (Skills, Experience, Education)
- Configurable and controlled skill extraction
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Custom exception handling for robust error management
- Unit tests using `pytest`
- Output structure documented using a JSON schema

How to Run

1.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2.Place a PDF or DOCX resume file in the project directory.

3.Run the parser:

python main.py


The parsed output will be printed in structured JSON format.

## Notes

-Resume files are not included in the repository for privacy reasons.
-The project is intentionally framework-agnostic and focuses on core Python.
-Designed to be easily extended for additional resume sections or formats.
